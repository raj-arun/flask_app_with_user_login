## Flask Blog Application
I wanted to learn flask by creating a flask blog application. I am following the tutorial by Corey Schafer on YouTube

### The flask app will have the following capabilities:
  - Register as a new user
  - Login to the application
  - Create, edit, delete and view blog posts
  - The password is encrypted and stored
  - Edit your account details like profile picutre, password, email id etc

### Dependencies
  - Python 3.6
  - flask
  - flask_wtf
  - flask-sqlalchemy
  - flask-bcrypt
  - Bootstrap Framework

### Execution Steps
  - Make sure you have all the libraries installed along with Python
  - Go to the root directory of the app
  - Open Terminal (mac) / Powershell (windows) in the root directory of the app
  - Type "python run.py"
